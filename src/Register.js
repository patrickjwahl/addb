                <p>Make sure to send him your "outlaw" name (that is, the one ya go by in the "Wild West" of the Internet!) 
                and a "secret code" (but since he's the <i>law</i>, don't let him have your <i>real</i> secret code!)</p>

                <p>In case you don't speak cowboy (in which case, reevaluate your life), just send the username and password 
                you want to use to the email above. Obviously don't use your normal password because Sebastian is a known identity thief.</p>
